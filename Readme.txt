Thank you for taking the time to go through my code repository.  I'll include a brief table of contents and description here.  SDET samples(java) are LDS, LDSAutomation, MphasisTest, and WordCount test. Samples from university(c#) are cimmerian shade educational.

BankAssignment - These are design documents for the LDS project

cimmerian shade cs files - here are three cs files that I put the most work into for my 3d capstone project.  Here is a link to the media (screenshots and video demonstration, project no longer hosted on the website) https://sites.google.com/site/joshselmserprojects/cimmerian-shade/classroom-pictures.

educational game cs file - This was another senior year project where I worked with a 4th grade science class to create an educational game about electricity and circuits

LDS/LDS Automation -  This is a SDET TDD java web app, that was my final project in Revature's bootcamp.

MphasisTest - Through Revature I was contracted to Mphasis and through them JPMC. This was an interview test.

WordCount - This was an interview test after my time with Revature.
